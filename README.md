# -Understanding-Cyber-Security-Basics-Attack-Surface
Understanding core cybersecurity concepts including the CIA triad, common attacker types, OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and data flow analysis. This repository documents foundational security knowledge with real-world examples and diagrams.

## 📌 Overview

This repository presents a structured and in-depth exploration of cybersecurity fundamentals with a focus on understanding attack surfaces and real-world threats. It covers core security principles, common attacker types, OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, and data flow analysis to identify where and how applications can be attacked.
The project was developed as part of a cybersecurity internship to build strong foundational knowledge and security-oriented thinking.

## 🎯 Objectives

Understand the core principles of cybersecurity (CIA Triad)
Identify different types of cyber attackers and their motivations
Explore common attack surfaces in modern applications
Study OWASP Top 10 web application security risks
Analyze application data flow to locate potential attack points
Develop threat awareness for real-world systems

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
Types of Attackers: Script Kiddies, Insider Threats, Hacktivists, Nation-State Actors
Attack Surfaces: Web Applications, Mobile Apps, APIs, Networks, Cloud Infrastructure
OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
Attack Point Identification

## 🔍 Attack Surface Analysis

This project analyzes how everyday applications such as email, messaging apps, and banking systems expose multiple attack surfaces. Each surface is evaluated to understand how attackers exploit vulnerabilities at different layers including user input, application logic, network communication, server processing, and database storage.

## 🔄 Data Flow Analysis

A detailed data flow model (User → Application → Server → Database) is used to:
Visualize how data moves through an application
Identify trust boundaries
Map potential attacks at each stage of the flow
Relate vulnerabilities to the CIA triad

## 📘 OWASP Top 10 Coverage

The repository includes an in-depth explanation of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks, highlighting:
Why each vulnerability is dangerous
How attackers exploit them
Their real-world impact on security

## 🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used

OWASP Top 10
Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
Threat Modeling Concepts
Secure Application Design Principles

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals
Ability to identify and analyze attack surfaces

Practical knowledge of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

Improved threat modeling and security analysis skills
